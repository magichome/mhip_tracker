# mhip_tracker : Performance

## Batteries

- With fully charged batteries, tracker worked for 5+ days without charging.  
- Once the batteries were depleted, tracker started working again after x hours in decent sunlight.

## GPS

- Outstanding.

## DHT

- Temperature goes rogue occassionally.  When it's right, it's pretty accurate.  But sometimes it gives a reading about 50% higher than actual.  I'm attempting to do some validation on the temperature readings and only report those that seem accurate but the algorithm needs more work.

## Celluar Connectivity

- TBD

## Cost
